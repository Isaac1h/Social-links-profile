# Social-links-profile

A social links profile was created in HTML and CSS as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge. The mobile and desktop design provided served as a reference, with the HTML structured and styling applied according to the style guide while incorporating personal adjustments. The profile is interactive, featuring hover effects and keyboard-accessible navigation, respecting the layout and visual elements of the original design.
